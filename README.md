Multiple Bill Calculator
===============

This is a tool to help Louisiana lawyers quickly calculate minimum and maximum sentences 
under the state's [Habitual Offender Law](http://hueylaw.org/site/index.php?type=docid&s=79154).
The project uses many open source tools including:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git)
* [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)
* [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js)

Multiple Bill Calculator was created as a part of the [Litigation and Technology Clinic](http://loyolalawtech.org) of 
[Loyola College of Law, New Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).
